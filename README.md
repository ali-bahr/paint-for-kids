Educational games are enjoyable ways for entertaining and teaching kids. Through this game, kids could draw simple, colorful shapes, save and/or load shapes through files, and play 
games that help them differentiate between shapes.

The game offers an engaging experience while demonstrating the power of object-oriented design; the project leverages object-oriented 
programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
